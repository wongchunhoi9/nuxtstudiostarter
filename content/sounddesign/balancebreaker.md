<!-- Lost and Found Anything Store is a long term project. The artist take the initiative to uncover and focus on the abandoned lost objects in certain sites, which will be transformed into digital 3D models and re-imagined in a half-realistic, half-inferential free-association. In the midst of the unpredictable objects, a small history is written with these young relics -->
