## Concept

Cardboard boxes are ubiquitous in Hong Kong, used for moving, packing and for decluttering our homes – and commonly collected, reused and recycled. What does this accessible and versatile material have to do with music? Composer Rita Yung and visual artist Wong Chun Hoi (hoi9) have created an immersive installation inspired by Hong Kong’s many storage warehouses, using boxes, electronic devices and lighting, accompanied by a composed electronic soundscape supported by musicians from the HKNME. Paper Boxing is part of the Sonic Visual Interplay series.
用於搬運、整理和包裝的紙箱對香港人來說並不陌生。 這種用途廣泛的材料與音樂有什麼關係? 我們誠邀您體驗作曲家、藝術家和音樂家共同以聲音及裝置藝術描繪的倉庫。
