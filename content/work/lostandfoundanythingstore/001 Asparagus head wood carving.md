itemStoryEnglish: The tips of the nails can hook the strings; the plates between the fingers can pluck the strings; the flat surfaces on the back of the fingers can press the keys; the wooden pieces on the tips of the fingers can be used as bows; the branches can be used as drum sticks; the curves between the fingers can match the flute; the hollow structure can be used as a mouthpiece for wind instruments... Such a versatile instrument is the best partner for street musicians in other countries... Let's call it " Musical Instrument Companion"! A semi-finished product that carries the creator's fantasy and becomes a semi-finished product forever with the destruction of the creator's fantasy.
itemStoryChinese: 「指甲的尖端能勾弦；指間的板塊能撥弦；指背的平面能按鍵；指尖的木片能作琴弓；套上樹枝能作鼓棍；指間內弧度配合笛子；中空的結構可作管樂的吹嘴...如此萬用的樂器工具，是流落他鄉街頭音樂人的最佳拍檔...就稱作「樂器伴侶」吧！」背負創作者幻想的半製成品，伴隨創作者幻想的破滅，而成為永遠的半製成品。
