A stone sculpture based on kombu. A tribute to Oden.

It is said that in the famous painting "The Birth of Venus", Venus originally stood not on top of a shell, but among the seaweed. According to the legend, the first god, Uranus, was castrated by his son, and the separated part fell into the sea and turned into foam to become Venus. The financier gave him a long poem "Giostina" describing the birth of Venus and responded: "Just follow the reference for me, it's important that the picture looks good.

以昆布為藍本的石雕。向關東煮致敬

據說，名畫《維納斯的誕生》中，維納斯本來不是站在貝殼之上，而是站在海草之間。這是由於傳說之中，維納斯是由第一代主神烏拉諾斯被其子閹割的部份掉到海中後的泡沫化成的（掉碌O落海的典故），畫家波提切利曾抗議問道，碌O怎樣才能掉到貝殼中？而出資方給了他一篇描述維納斯誕生的長詩《吉奧斯特納》，回應道：給我跟著reference就好，最緊要畫面好看。
