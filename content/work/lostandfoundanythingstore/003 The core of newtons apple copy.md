Bruno Bucciarati, a beautiful young gangster from Naples, Italy, with a clear head, calm and cool, loves his fellow man, hates drugs, and has the Stand "Sticky Fingers" ...... If you don't know what I'm talking about, you may want to google it. As to why this wood carving is related to him, the artist said, "Look at the fingers on the edge of it and the heart-shaped hole in the middle, doesn't it look like the open chest part of his clothes? I said, "Forget about the cat-like fingers, but Giorno Giovanna is the one who has a heart-shaped chest opening in his clothes!

Bruno Bucciarati，意大利那不勒斯的年輕黑幫美男子，頭腦清晰、沉著冷靜、愛護同伴、痛恨毒品，擁有替身能力「Sticky Fingers」......如果你不知道我在說什麼，不妨google一下。至於為什麼這件木雕與他有關，藝術家說：「看它邊緣的手指，還有中間心型的孔洞，不像他衣服的開胸部份嗎？」我說，先不提那貓掌般的手指，但衣服是心型開胸的角色是Giorno Giovanna才對吧！
