Applewood wands are not mass-produced. They are very energetic and suitable for holders with high goals and ideals, as the wood is less compatible with black magic. It is said that apple wood wand holders will be loved and live a long life, and I often find that charismatic clients are chosen by apple wood wands. Applewood wand bearers often have the unusual ability to communicate with other magical creatures in their language, including mermaids: Dylan Marwood, the famous author of a comprehensive guide to their language and customs.

Although not every apple wood wand holder can release magic, its shape, quality, feel, and weight distribution make it very suitable for use with gravity blunts or throwing weapons... It is also known as the immortal "Newton's Magic".

杯口設計先向內收窄，有助將風味、香氣凝聚，而將咖啡倒進口時，隨杯口外擴而接觸到更廣闊的味蕾，將咖啡風味放大。最適合喝濃味的深炒印尼蘇門答臘曼特寧豆，喝下去，廿四味般滋味在舌頭。
